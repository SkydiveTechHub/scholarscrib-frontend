 * slow-committing transaction can be skipped by a read that advances a topic's
 * cursor past it. Phase 1 ships no automatic reconciliation (the spec assigns a
 * daily cursor-reset-and-replay to Phase 3). Until then, bumping this constant
 * forces a full per-topic replay on the next read and repairs any such drift.
 *
 * Bumped to 2 in Phase 2, which added per-channel observation counts. Existing
 * rows have no counts and no write can backfill them; the version mismatch
 * forces a full replay from the ledger on next read, which recomputes them
 * from source.
