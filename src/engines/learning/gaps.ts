  // gates on raw `observations` instead, which do not decay. Gating it on
  // confidence would make it chase `retention`: both fall with age, so a
  // topic could become DECAYED and then silently stop being DECAYED purely by
  // getting staler — exactly the case DECAYED exists to catch.

  // and about other topics' mastery, not about how well we know this one.
