/**
 * ScholarsCrib — Learning Ledger Backfill
 *
 * The Learning Evidence Layer (see
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-learning-evidence-layer-design.md) reads
 * per-subject counts and topic mastery from the `LearningEvent` ledger, but
 * the ledger only started being written the day that layer shipped —
 * `assessment-submit.ts` emits a `QUESTION_ANSWERED` event per graded answer
 * going forward, but every `QuestionResponse` row that predates that change
 * has no corresponding ledger row. This script replays that history in.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — occurredAt:
 * `QuestionResponse` carries no timestamp of its own (no createdAt column on
 * that model). The closest fact we have is the attempt it belongs to, so
 * every response's `occurredAt` is stamped with `attempt.completedAt` (or
 * `attempt.startedAt` as a fallback for the rare row where `completedAt` is
 * somehow null on a COMPLETED attempt). This is coarser than a per-response
 * timestamp — all of one attempt's answers land on the same instant — but it
 * is real history, not `now()`. The scoring layer applies a 45-day half-life
 * decay (see src/engines/learning/fold.ts), so stamping backfilled rows with
 * the current time would make years-old answers outweigh recent ones and
 * badly corrupt every mastery figure downstream. Do not "fix" this by
 * defaulting to `now()`.
 *
 * Idempotency & resumability:
 * The script walks students in id-ordered batches (a cursor, not an offset,
 * so concurrent inserts elsewhere can't shift the window). For each student
 * it first checks whether *any* `QUESTION_ANSWERED` LearningEvent already
 * exists for them; if so, the whole student is skipped — this is what makes
 * a second run over the same database a no-op, including a run that was
 * interrupted partway through the previous one. Because the check is
 * per-student and students are processed one at a time, a crash mid-run
 * loses at most the in-flight student's batch, and re-running the script
 * picks up exactly where it left off without re-reading or re-checking
 * anyone already done.
 *
 * After writing a student's events, `TopicMastery.cursorSeq` is reset to 0
 * for every topic row that student already has a TopicMastery cache for, so
 * the next read replays the full ledger (including the newly-inserted
 * historical events) instead of trusting a cache that predates them.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-learning-events.ts                  # dry run (default)
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-learning-events.ts --write           # actually write
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-learning-events.ts --write --batch-size=25
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-learning-events.ts --student=<id>    # limit to one student
 *
 * DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT (dry-run or otherwise) without confirming the
 * database is reachable and it is safe to do so — see the fix plan, Task 7.
